                <h3>Where crafters come together for community, creativity, and crafting</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to give crafters a place to coordinate crafting play dates, share crafting items, and form a crafting community.</p>

            <p>A crafter can add their crafting items that they feel comfortable sharing with other crafters, either loaning out or having someone come over to use. They can also comment on other crafters' items that they would like to try out. This allows us to expand our creativity without having to expand our wallets. </p>

            <h4>Let's get crafty!</h4>
